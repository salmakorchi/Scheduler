this project is a scheduler application that let's you create new events or book old ones 
  the project was made using these technologies:
  REACT js,Node Js,mongoDB,Mongoose,graphql,bootstrap,html5,
  css3,javascript,bycript,dataloader,jsonwebtoken and much more
this application manages tokens and crypts the password 
and uses dataloader to minimize the time of load of the data and makes it quicker,
  and that's done by sending multiple query requests at a time instead of sending just one
Mongoose acts like a link between the mongoDB database and the app
and GraphQl is a api that manipulates data and queries
